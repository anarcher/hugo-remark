  ## Markdown extensions
]
.right-column[
To help out with slide layout and formatting, a few Markdown extensions have been included:

- Slide properties, for naming, styling and templating slides

- Content classes, for styling specific content

- Syntax highlighting, supporting a range of languages
]

---
.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
  ### - Slide properties
]
.right-column[
Initial lines containing key-value pairs are extracted as slide properties:

```remark
name: agenda
class: middle, center

# Agenda

The name of this slide is {{ name }}.
```

Slide properties serve multiple purposes:

* Naming and styling slides using properties `name` and `class`

* Using slides as templates using properties `template` and `layout`

* Expansion of `{{ property }}` expressions to property values

See the [complete list](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Markdown#slide-properties) of slide properties.

Any occurences of one or more dotted CSS class names followed by square brackets are replaced with the contents of the brackets with the specified classes applied:

```remark
.footnote[.red.bold[*] Important footnote]
```

Resulting HTML extract:

```xml
<span class="footnote">
  <span class="red bold">*</span> Important footnote
</span>
```

  ### - Syntax Highlighting
]
.right-column[
Code blocks can be syntax highlighted by specifying a language from the set of [supported languages](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration#highlighting).

Using [GFM](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) fenced code blocks you can easily specify highlighting language:

.pull-left[

<pre><code>```javascript
function add(a, b)
  return a + b
end
```</code></pre>
]
.pull-right[

<pre><code>```ruby
def add(a, b)
  a + b
end
```</code></pre>
]

A number of highlighting [styles](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration#highlighting) are available, including several well-known themes from different editors and IDEs.

  ## Presenter mode
]
.right-column[
To help out with giving presentations, a presenter mode comprising the
following features is provided:

- Display of slide notes for the current slide, to help you remember
  key points

- Display of upcoming slide, to let you know what's coming

- Cloning of slideshow for viewing on extended display
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Presenter mode
  ### - Inline notes
]
.right-column[
Just like three dashes separate slides,
three question marks separate slide content from slide notes:

```
Slide 1 content

*???

Slide 1 notes

---

Slide 2 content

*???

Slide 2 notes
```

Slide notes are also treated as Markdown, and will be converted in the
same manner slide content is.

Pressing __P__ will toggle presenter mode.

???
Congratulations, you just toggled presenter mode!

Now press __P__ to toggle it back off.

.left-column[
  ## Presenter mode
  ### - Inline notes
  ### - Cloned view
]
.right-column[
Presenter mode of course makes no sense to the audience.

Creating a cloned view of your slideshow lets you:

- Move the cloned view to the extended display visible to the audience

- Put the original slideshow in presenter mode

- Navigate as usual, and the cloned view will automatically keep up with the original

Pressing __C__ will open a cloned view of the current slideshow in a new
browser window.
