As the slideshow is expressed using Markdown, you may:

- Focus on the content, expressing yourself in next to plain text not worrying what flashy graphics and disturbing effects to put where

As the slideshow is actually an HTML document, you may:

- Display it in any decent browser

- Style it using regular CSS, just like any other HTML content

- Use it offline!

As the slideshow is contained in a plain file, you may:

- Store it wherever you like; on your computer, hosted from your Dropbox, hosted on Github Pages alongside the stuff you're presenting...

- Easily collaborate with others, keeping track of changes using your favourite SCM tool, like Git or Mercurial
